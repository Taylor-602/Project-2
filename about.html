      We are a vibrant cat lounge and adoption center. We founded The Catio to
      be a haven for our rescue cats while providing a bright and joyful space
      for our loyal customers! All of our cats and kittens have been rescued by
      our partners at Nashville Cat Rescue. Each Le Chats kitty resident spends
      their days socializing with our guests during kitty time and our wide
      variety of events. This priceless enrichment allows the cats's
      personalities to blossom before they find forever homes. We proudly offer
      our beloved community of Nashville—both locals and tourists alike—a place
      to relax, play and adopt!

      This cat cafe was oringally opened in 1986 as a rescue center for cats.
      The owners decided they wanted to take a step into a new lifestyle to open
      up a cat cafe with all the rescues they found. Many years later, Le Cafe
      du Chat is still open to this day!
